# LowTechSensorFil

/!\ This is a test and there is a major flow in the design, please do not use

This is a basic filament runout sensor, it is designed to be used with 
 - D2F-L Omron sensor 
 - 2 5*3 nodimium magnets
 - 1 m3*8 screw as hinge
 - 2 m3*xx depending on what you hook it up

The principle is to mount the filmanent sensor on a base via two m3 on the bottom.
The m3 screw on the top is used as a lever to detect untangled spool.
